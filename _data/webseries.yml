  summary: Imagine when you looked at someone, you could see their heartbeat. A suite of techniques called imaging photoplethysmography has recently enabled contactless measurements of vital signs with cameras by leveraging small intensity changes in the skin caused by cardiac activity. Measuring vital signs remotely is advantageous in several applications, including virtual doctor appointments, especially relevant during a pandemic, as well as more comfortable sleep monitoring, or monitoring of prematurely born infants. However, the camera-based physiological signals are very weak and easily corrupted by varying illumination, video compression artifacts, and head motion. Therefore, most existing methods only work in controlled settings and fail in realistic applications. We developed a denoising deep learning algorithm based on convolutional attention networks that can faithfully recover physiological signals even from heavily corrupted videos. Moreover, our denoising algorithm can recover subtle waveform dynamics, previously not possible to measure with cameras. We also discuss how we can improve the performance of deep learning methods and avoid overfitting when training on very small and not diverse datasets.
