        We give the gift of sight to machines. We do this by building computational imaging systems that tightly couple computer algorithms (CS) and imaging hardware (ECE). If successful, computational imaging has the potential to unleash an era of superhuman robotics.

        Imagine if surgical robots could perform impossible surgeries by seeing details invisible to a human doctor.

        To work towards these dreams, our lab focuses on three technical
        pillars that we push, explore and test.

      <p class="body-sci-miss">
        A computational imaging system tightly integrates software
        processing and optical capture to form novel imagery. Our group
        builds computational imaging systems that can see through scattering
        media, around corners, and more. We study visual constructs like
        light fields, time of flight imaging, polarization, and coherent
        optics. These constructs are parsed using signal processing and
        numerical methods. ECE 239 is a new UCLA course that covers the
        nascent field of computational imaging

      <p class="sub-heading">Pillar II: Computational Robotic Imaging</p>
      <p class="body-sci-miss">
        In an approach we call “computational robotic imaging”, we generalize
        pillar I to a co-design of algorithms, optics and robotics. Inspired
        by the diversity of animal eyes, we believe that vision systems will
        evolve with the needs of robots. Imagine if a self-driving car had a
        vision system that could see obstacles before it turned a corner.

      <p class="sub-heading">Pillar III: Computational Health Imaging</p>
      <p class="body-sci-miss">
        With an expertise in algorithms and optics, we build imaging systems
        for healthcare applications. Imagine the possibility of imaging
        through scattering media, like biological tissue. Ordinarily one has
        had to use X-rays or MRI. However, it might be possible to use novel
        optical and computational methods, like speckle or transient inversion
        to see deeper through the skin. The method at right is able to see
        deep subsurface veins (to identify blood clots), using spatially coded
        visible light. Imagine if similar techniques could be used as a
        low-cost, high throughput screening method for cancers.
