        Visual signals describe the space-time of our world. It can therefore be argued that a visual representation (with sufficient granularity) can simulate any entity. The Visual Machines Group is charting an ambitious path to simulate the human body and simulate how humans interact with sensors, to make equitable and better performing healthcare devices.
