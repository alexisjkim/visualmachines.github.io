#### [Frontiers in Computational Imaging and Sensing - Monthly Lecture Series]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/web_series.md %})

The Frontiers in Computational Imaging (FCI) is a unique lecture series in computational
imaging that highlights junior stars in the field. The series is co-organized by
[UCLA]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/home_page.md %}) and [Caltech](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~klbouman/). 
Inspired by the hardships junior researchers face during COVID-19, [Akasha Imaging](http://akasha.im/) 
generously provides a small monetary award to all speakers with a non-permanent academic position 
(e.g. PhD student, postdoc). Computational imaging is an emerging field with many virtual events 
happening - we encourage visitors to check out a related seminar from our colleagues at CMU/Rice/MIT 
as well as the SPACE seminar series (linked below). For questions, please write the lead organizer
[Pradyumna Chari](https://pradyumnachari.github.io/).
